# KPPTR-firmware

Welcome to the KPPTR-firmware repository! This repository contains the firmware code for an on-board computer designed to enhance the capabilities of DIY amateur rockets and high-altitude balloons. The computer is powered by the ESP32-S3 SoC, providing the necessary computational power for various tasks during the flight. Both hardware and sofware was developed by PTR member!

## Project Overview

The main branch of this repository currently houses the firmware code written in C, utilizing the ESP-IDF 4.4 framework. To compile the software, you'll need the ESP-IDF 4.4 framework, which you can download from [here](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/?idf=4.4).

## Software Components

This project is composed of several distinct software components, each responsible for a specific aspect of the on-board computer's functionality. Here's a brief overview of each component:

- **AHRS_driver**: This computing engine is tasked with processing data related to attitude, altitude, velocity, and more, providing crucial insights during the flight.
- **Analog_driver**: Responsible for handling the Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) process, enabling measurements of Vbat (battery voltage) and the continuity of igniters.
- **BOARD**: This component defines board-specific configurations, ensuring seamless integration of the firmware with the hardware.
- **DataManager**: Efficiently packs data into Flash and RF frames, facilitating high-speed communication between the AHRS task and the Storage task.
- **esp_littlefs**: An external LittleFS library, augmenting file system capabilities for the project.
- **FLASH_driver**: While not currently used, this component is reserved for potential future integration with external Flash memory.
- **FlightStateDetector**: Detects the current flight state, contributing to accurate decision-making during the mission.
- **GNSS_driver**: Manages communication with the GNSS receiver, gathering essential location data.
- **IGN_driver**: Drives igniter outputs, crucial for controlled actions during the flight.
- **LED_driver**: Takes charge of LED (both standard and addressable) and buzzer control, aiding in visual and auditory signaling.
- **LIS331_driver**: Handles communication with LIS331 family acceleration sensors, vital for monitoring acceleration data.
- **LORA_driver**: Configures and facilitates data transmission using the LORA module and the provided SX126x_driver.
- **LSM6DSO32_driver**: Communicates with one or more LSM6DSO32 acceleration and gyro sensors, contributing to accurate motion tracking.
- **MMC5983MA_driver**: Manages communication with the MMC5983MA magnetometer sensor, essential for tracking magnetic fields.
- **MS5607_driver**: Establishes communication with the MS5607 pressure sensor, providing data about atmospheric pressure changes.
- **OpenLog_driver**: Currently not in use, this component is reserved for potential future utilization with an external blackbox.
- **Preferences**: Enables the application and modification of settings stored in Flash memory.
- **Sensors**: Serves as a higher-level component that utilizes drivers from various sensors, ensuring coordinated functionality.
- **Servo_driver**: Reserved for potential future use with servo motors.
- **soc**: This is a copy of the IDF component with applied fixes in the SPI driver.
- **SPI_driver**: Provides a custom API for the SPI peripheral, enhancing communication capabilities.
- **Storage_driver**: Handles data storage in Flash memory, ensuring important data is retained for later analysis.
- **SX126x_driver**: A library for the LORA module provided by the manufacturer, simplifying LORA communication.
- **SysMgr**: Acts as the system manager, monitoring the states of critical components to ensure reliable operation.
- **Telemetry_driver**: Currently not used, this component is reserved for potential future use.
- **Web_driver**: Manages the Web GUI, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the on-board computer.
